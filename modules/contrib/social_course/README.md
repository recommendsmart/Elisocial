# Social Course

This module allows Community Managers to create courses for their members.
A Course is a step-by-step program that guides users through a course complete
with video, text and an opportunity for users to keep track of their progress.
You can look up courses via the *all courses* overview, usually positioned
under the *explore menu*.
